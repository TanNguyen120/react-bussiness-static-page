            <p>They are coming for you.
                Give in to your fear.
                Kill them all before they kill you.
                They have turned against you. Now, take your revenge.
                It WAS your fault.
                Tell yourself again that these are not truly your friends.
                You are a pawn of forces unseen.
                There is no escape. Not in this life, not in the next.</p>
